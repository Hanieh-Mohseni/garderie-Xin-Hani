## Functionality

In this project, all information related to teachers, children, classes, foods, and the activities of each class, admin, and children's registration information is stored in the database.

It provides different pages for retrieving records, removing, adding, and editing various information related to teachers, children, admins, classes, news, food, and activities of each class. (CRUD)

A search page is provided for the user to access information about the classes, based on the food, activity, and teacher of each class.

It is possible to load files and photos from the database and display photos of foods and activities, as well as edit and upload new files and photos and save them for foods and activities.

It is possible to retrieve news from the database, edit and also display it on the home page for the end-user

A page called Enrolment has been provided for the end-user, which allows registration on the available dates, and after registration, this information will be stored in the database.

On another page named Enrolled, the admin can retrieve them from the database, review, edit, or remove each registered record, and change the registration status to ACCEPTED, REFUSED, WAITING, and INITIATE.


### The second phase of this project, which is currently being implemented and will be added soon, including:
The possibility of login, authentication, and providing access levels for admin, end-user, and teachers
Validation
password Encryption 
And using more CSS techniques to beautify the end user-related part.
